## Overview

BasePack implements a robust testing framework that ensures package reliability while maintaining flexibility for future development. The testing approach prioritizes architectural adaptability, making it easier to evolve the codebase without breaking existing functionality.

## Testing Architecture

We've structured our tests into three distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose in our quality assurance process:

### Unit Tests (`tests/Unit/`)
These form the foundation of our testing strategy. Unit tests focus on individual components, testing them in complete isolation from external dependencies. This approach helps us catch issues early and ensures each piece of our codebase works correctly on its own.

### Integration Tests (`tests/Integration/`)
At this level, we test how different parts of BasePack work together. These tests verify that our package integrates properly with Laravel's ecosystem and that our components interact correctly with each other.

### Feature Tests (`tests/Feature/`)
Feature tests represent the user's perspective. They test complete workflows and ensure that our commands work as expected in real-world scenarios. These tests give us confidence that the package delivers on its promises.

### Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach is built on several key principles:

**Interface-First Testing**: We test what our code does, not how it does it. This means we can refactor internals without rewriting tests, as long as the public interface remains consistent.

**Isolation & Independence**: Each test runs independently, with external dependencies properly mocked. This ensures tests are fast, reliable, and don't interfere with each other.

**Layered Validation**: Our three-tier approach provides comprehensive coverage:
```
Feature Tests     → End-to-end validation
Integration Tests → Component interaction
Unit Tests        → Individual class logic
```

## Test Organization

Our test suite is organized to mirror the package structure while maintaining clear separation of concerns:

### Core Components
- **Service Provider Tests**: Ensure proper Laravel integration and command registration
- **Command Tests**: Validate command structure, options, and basic functionality
- **Helper Tests**: Verify utility classes work correctly in isolation

### Integration Scenarios
- **Component Interaction**: Test how helpers work together
- **Laravel Integration**: Verify seamless framework integration
- **Configuration Handling**: Ensure proper config merging and access

### End-to-End Workflows
- **Command Execution**: Test complete command workflows
- **Package Lifecycle**: Verify installation and setup processes
- **Error Handling**: Ensure graceful failure scenarios

## Running the Test Suite

We've made running tests as straightforward as possible. Here are the main ways to execute our test suite:

### Standard PHPUnit

```bash
# Run everything
vendor/bin/phpunit

# Focus on specific test types
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Unit
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Integration
vendor/bin/phpunit --testsuite=Feature

# Generate coverage reports
vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage-report
```

### Using the BasePack Test Command

When BasePack is installed in a Laravel project, you can use our custom test command:

```bash
php artisan basepack:test                    # Complete test suite
php artisan basepack:test --suite=unit       # Just unit tests
php artisan basepack:test --coverage         # With coverage reporting
php artisan basepack:test --filter=Helper    # Filter specific tests
php artisan basepack:test --verbose          # Detailed output
```

### Development Shortcuts

We've included a Makefile with convenient shortcuts for common testing tasks:

```bash
make test          # Quick test run
make test-unit     # Unit tests only
make test-coverage # Generate coverage report
make ci            # Full CI simulation
```

## Continuous Integration

Our CI pipeline runs automatically on every push and pull request, ensuring code quality remains high:

- **Multi-PHP Testing**: We test against PHP 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 to ensure broad compatibility
- **Laravel Version Matrix**: Tests run against Laravel 10.x, 11.x, and 12.x
- **Dependency Variations**: Both `prefer-lowest` and `prefer-stable` scenarios are covered
- **Quality Gates**: Code validation, PSR-4 compliance, and security audits

For local development, you can simulate the CI environment:

```bash
make ci            # Run the full CI pipeline locally
make clean         # Clean up test artifacts
```

## Why This Approach Works

### Refactoring Confidence
Our testing strategy focuses on behavior rather than implementation details. This means you can restructure code internally without breaking tests, as long as the public API remains stable.

### Living Documentation
Tests serve as executable documentation. New team members can look at our test suite to understand how components should behave and how they're intended to be used.

### Regression Protection
With comprehensive test coverage, we catch regressions automatically. This safety net allows for bold improvements without fear of breaking existing functionality.

### Cross-Version Reliability
By testing against multiple PHP and Laravel versions, we ensure BasePack works reliably across different environments.

## Development Workflow

### Adding New Features
When implementing new functionality, we follow a test-driven approach:

1. **Start with a failing test** that describes the desired behavior
2. **Write minimal implementation** to make the test pass
3. **Refactor with confidence**, knowing tests will catch any regressions

### Modifying Existing Code
Before changing existing functionality:

1. **Verify test coverage** for the area you're modifying
2. **Run tests** to establish a baseline
3. **Make your changes** incrementally
4. **Confirm tests still pass** after each change

### Bug Fixes
When addressing bugs:

1. **Write a test** that reproduces the issue
2. **Confirm the test fails** with the current code
3. **Fix the bug** until the test passes
4. **Run the full suite** to ensure no regressions

## Final Thoughts

This testing framework gives us the confidence to evolve BasePack rapidly while maintaining reliability. The combination of comprehensive coverage, architectural flexibility, and automated validation ensures that we can continue improving the package without fear of breaking existing functionality.

The investment in quality testing pays dividends in development speed, code reliability, and maintainer confidence. As BasePack grows, this foundation will support increasingly complex features while keeping the codebase stable and trustworthy.
