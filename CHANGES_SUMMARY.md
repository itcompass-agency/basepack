## 🔒 Security Fixes

### Redis Security Hardening (CVE-2025-49844 Mitigation)

**Critical security vulnerability addressed:** CVE-2025-49844 - Redis Lua scripting vulnerability

#### Changes Made:

1. **New Redis Configuration File**
   - Created: `stubs/docker/redis/redis.conf`
   - Features:
     - Password authentication required
     - Protected mode enabled
     - Network isolation (bind 0.0.0.0 with authentication)
     - Dangerous commands disabled (FLUSHDB, FLUSHALL, CONFIG, SHUTDOWN, DEBUG)
     - Memory management configured (maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru)
     - Secure logging and persistence settings

2. **Updated Docker Compose Files**

   **`stubs/docker-compose.yml.stub` (Development):**
   - Updated Redis image: `redis:alpine` → `redis:7.4-alpine`
   - Removed public port exposure (security best practice)
   - Added volume mount for redis.conf
   - Added password authentication via environment variable
   - Added healthcheck with authentication
   - Added restart policy

   **`stubs/docker-compose-prod.yml.stub` (Production):**
   - Same security updates as development
   - Production-optimized configuration
   - No external port exposure

3. **Updated Environment Configuration**

   **`stubs/.env.docker.stub`:**
   - Changed `REDIS_PASSWORD=null` → `REDIS_PASSWORD=CHANGE_ME_TO_STRONG_PASSWORD`
   - Removed `REDIS_OUTER_PORT` (security - prevents public exposure)
   - Added security warnings and comments

#### Security Benefits:

✅ Prevents unauthorized access to Redis
✅ Mitigates CVE-2025-49844 Lua scripting vulnerability
✅ Disables dangerous commands that could delete data
✅ Ensures Redis is only accessible via Docker internal network
✅ Uses latest Redis version with security patches
✅ Implements defense-in-depth security strategy

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Before First Release:

1. **Review all documentation** for accuracy
2. **Test security configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Build with new Redis config
   make build --no-cache

   # Verify Redis requires authentication
   docker exec basepack-redis redis-cli ping
   # Should fail without password

   # Test with password
   docker exec basepack-redis redis-cli -a YOUR_PASSWORD ping
   # Should return PONG
   ```

3. **Update version number** in `composer.json` from `0.0.1` to `1.0.0`

4. **Run full test suite**:
   ```bash
   vendor/bin/phpunit --coverage-html coverage-report
   ```

5. **Create git tag** for version 1.0.0:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial release with Redis security hardening"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

6. **Submit to Packagist** (if not already done)
